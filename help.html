<h1>Help for &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; (grelf.itch.io/viii)</h1>
<p>You will start on an island. You will see your position on a map. 
Your island may be small or it may be very large. The map is limitless and you are free to 
explore. Your aim is to collect certain objects, the nature and quantity of which you might guess 
from the title.</p>
<p>The map will be different every time you start the game because it is randomly generated. 
However, if you like a particular map there are buttons for saving and reloading games.</p>
<p>If you need to go between islands you may be able to find a helicopter to enter and fly. There 
are sometimes underground links between islands. There are other ways to do it too.</p>
<p>There are useful things to be found underground and inside buildings. You will need them.</p>
<p>The graphical display can show either a map or a scene. The map contains, initially in the centre,
a red circle with a point. This indicates where you are standing and the direction you are facing 
when you switch from the map to a scene. The dashed red circle around your map position indicates 
how far you can see, fog and other objects permitting. 
<strong>Map scale:</strong> the black north lines are 300m (metres) apart.</p>

<p>The program may be controlled either by clicking on buttons displayed in the page or, if you have 
a keyboard, by pressing keys. Each button indicates the related key. In some cases if you hover over 
a button you will see that there are alternative keys which may be more convenient to use.</p>
<p>The buttons and keys available will change depending on the visible content of the main graphical 
display area.</p>
<p>Generally you can move the map or move your viewpoint around in a scene by using the lower row of 
buttons or arrow keys. Using keys is faster.</p>

<h2>Roles</h2>
<p>At the left below the title there is a drop-down for changing your role. There are 
several possibilities. <strong>Explorer</strong> is your role at the start. Be aware that you 
can fall down mineshafts in this role but that is how to enter the underground mines.</p>
<p>Certain things can only happen if you are in suitable role. You may need to think about it.</p>
<h2>Some special buttons/keys</h2>
<p>These buttons may appear, depending on which graphical display is showing (map, ground, mine, 
etc).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Found (key f)</strong> shows the objects you have collected so far.</li>
<li><strong>Enter (&#x21a9;)</strong> As it implies, this key can be used to enter certain things 
when you are close enough to them. For example, enter a helicopter in which case it will fly up 10 
metres to give a view from that height. You can enter buildings and you will need to do so, to 
find information about your goal. There are some machines inside buildings too.</li>
<li><strong>Auto (u)</strong> In a ground or aerial scene this will set your viewpoint moving forward 
repeatedly until either an obstacle is met or you press another button/key. This is useful if you
have found a helicopter, for flying rapidly.</li>
<li>In certain roles you may see other buttons.</li>
<li>There are also buttons for saving games and reloading them. The data are kept in your browser, 
as long as you have not set the browser to delete data on exit.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There is much more to discover but these hints should get you started. Do take note of the 
map symbols box and the things you can adjust in the settings box.</em></p>
<h2>Some background information</h2>
<p>This game was partly inspired by a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_dollar" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> 
and also by the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/ssjrandomgeneration" target="_blank">July 2024 game jam</a> 
run by the Portland Indie Game Squad.</p>
<p>The limitless terrain is generated in real time as you explore it. It is programmed in plain old 
JavaScript (JS) to run in any graphical browser. It is all my own code without using any other 
libraries or frameworks. 
Graphical images are all from my own photos, processed in Affinity Photo to make PNG files having 
transparent surrounds. These are displayed in a simple 2D canvas element using my own perspective 
algorithm.</p>
<p>The terrain generator differs very little from its earliest version around 1982 when I wrote it 
in Z80 assembler to run in a TRS-80 having only 16 kilobytes(!) of programmable memory. In those 
days generating detailed terrain like this was perfectly possible in just a few kilobytes but it was 
not possible to display it in detail, either as a map or a scene.</p>
<p>My main interest was in simulating the sport of orienteering, particularly to help people 
understand contours for navigation. That was possible back in 1982 if the terrain was 
&quot;surveyed&quot; (laboriously) so that detailed maps could be printed to accompany the 
published game. That is why the maps you see in the current version are drawn to orienteering 
standards. Runnable woodland, the best terrain for the sport, is white on the map.</p>
<p>Reviews of my earliest versions can be found 
<a href="https://pixelatron.com/blog/explorer-an-exploration-game-from-before-there-were-exploration-games/" 
target="_blank">here (Pixelatron)<a> and 
<a href="https://www.crashonline.org.uk/01/forest.htm" target="_blank">here (Crash magazine)</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014 I started to rewrite the code in JS and discovered that browsers made it possible to 
display detailed graphics in a reasonable time and of course they continue to get more efficient. 
My code is object-oriented but in the original prototype style of JS.</p>
<p>If you go to my itch version of 
<a href="https://grelf.itch.io/forest" target="_blank">The Forest</a> (from which the 
current program is derived) you will find further documents, including a PDF file about how the 
terrain is generated.</p>
